# Introduction
The goal of this paper is to analyze the transportation dataset from the US Department of Transport (DOT) Statistics that are hosted as an Amazon EBS volume snapshot and answer a set of interesting questions about them.The dataset contains data and statistics on Aviation up to 2008 in CSV format. It contains flight data such as departure and arrival delays, flight times, etc.

All code and full results can be found at https://github.com/stephendimig/Cloud-Computing-Capstone-Task-2 .

# Methods and Data
## System Installation and Setup
All work for this paper was performed on Amazon Web Services using a virtual machine instance running HortonWorks Sandbox 2.1. An EBS volume was created from a pre-existing snapshot containing the DOT transportation data statistics and attached to the virtual machine. In addition to this basic setup, the Apache Cassandra NoSQL database and the R Programming Language were also installed.

For task 2 we will operate on real-time streaming data rather than batch processing it from a file. Apache Spark is a fast and general processing engine compatible with Hadoop data. It is designed to perform both batch processing (like MapReduce) or streaming. Apace Kafka is used to stream our cleaned data set to an Apache Spark process so we can simulate real-time arrival of large quantities of traffic.

## Apache Spark

![Apache Spark Ecosystem](spark.png)

The Spark programming model is built around Resilient Distributed Dataset or RDD. Think about RDD as a table in a database. It can hold any type of data. Spark stores data in RDD on different partitions. Programming is Spark involves performing a series of transformations on an RDD such as:

* map - Return a new distributed dataset formed by passing each element of the source through a function.
* filter - Return a new dataset formed by selecting those elements of the source on which func returns true.
* reduceByKey - Returns a dataset of pairs where the values for each key are aggregated using a function.
* sortByKey - Returns a dataset of (K, V) pairs sorted by keys in ascending or descending order.

These operations are pipelined in a series. The overall effect is very much like Lisp. It takes some getting used to, but is very powerful. In no time yo are writing something that looks like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_data = data.filter(lambda p: (flatten([(p[2] == xvals[index] and p[3] == yvals[index] and p[6] < 1200) or (p[2] == yvals[index] and p[3] == zvals[index] and p[6] > 1200) for index in range(0, len(xvals))])))
```

![Solution](solution.png)

## Group 1 Problems
The Group 1 Problems were solved using Spark SQL instead of the regular RDD operations. This is a nice package that lets you operate on an RDD like an SQL table.

```{r eval=FALSE}
sqlContext = getSqlContextInstance(rdd.context)
row_data = rdd.map(lambda p: Row(airport=p[0], total=int(p[1])))
df = sqlContext.createDataFrame(row_data)
df.registerTempTable("ontime")
handle = sqlContext.sql(""" SELECT * FROM ontime ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10 """)
handle.show()
```

This looks great, but it had serious problems with compound keys required later so it had to be abandoned.

## Group 2 Problems
The Group 2 Problems were the most complex as far as integration goes. I could not get the Cassandra/Python interface to work. I tried many different drivers including the TargetHolding pyspark driver, the DataStax pyspark driver, the DataStax python drive, various JDBC drivers and the technique described here:

```{r eval=FALSE}
https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/python/cassandra_outputformat.py
```

I ended up writing the data out in csv format to HDFS and writing a separate python daemon that monitored the directory and imported the csv file into Cassandra. Nothing worked. Interestingly enough I could connect using R and did for problem 3.2.

## Group 3 Problems
For the final problem I used a pyspark script that acts as a course filter to control the data that gets written to the Cassandra database. The pyspark script finds all of the flights from the X destination to the Y that depart before 1200 and all the fights that depart from Y to Z after 1200. Many trips can be combined in to one streaming job like his.

```{r eval=FALSE}
tomstrip.py localhost:2181 airline_ontime "BOS:ATL:LAX" "PHX:JFK:MSP" "DFW:STL:ORD" "LAX:MIA:LAX"
```

A R script then connects to the Cassandra database using a JDBC driver and performs the final analysis. This approach worked well.

# Discussion
I struggled mightily with this task but somehow got something that worked reasonably well. There was still serious problems though. If I had more time I would investigate the buffering that keeps the process working on data 30 minutes after the Kafka producer has terminated. I do believe this is an issue with parallelization. I would also make an attempt to locate a python JDBC driver since that worked with R. There was some definite data loss going on that I believe was the result of excessive buffering due to the slow response of the Spark program. Running several instances in parallel would have solved this giving higher speed and better reliability. I used global data in a couple of places and this would have to have been modified to run in parallel, but I believe that would have been minor. I did learn quite a bit doing this task and look forward to applying it in the future.
